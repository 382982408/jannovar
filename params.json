{"name":"Jannovar","tagline":"Java framework for annotating VCF files with gene/transcript-based annotations","body":"# Jannovar: A Java library for Exome Annotation\r\n\r\nTranscript-based annotation and pedigree analysis are two basic steps in the computational analysis of whole-exome sequencing experiments in disease-gene discovery projects or diagnostics. Jannovar is a stand-alone Java application as well as a Java library designed to be used in larger software frameworks for exome analysis. Jannovar uses an interval tree to identify all transcripts affected by a given variant, and provides HGVS-compliant annotations for both for variants affecting coding sequences and splice junctions as well as UTR sequences and non-coding RNA transcripts. Jannovar can also perform family-based pedigree analysis with VCF files with data from members of a family segregating a Mendelian disorder. Using a desktop computer, Jannovar requires a few seconds to annotate a typical VCF file with exome data.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\nThe following files comprise the main Jannovar application/library (Jannovar.jar) as well as a tutorial and a compressed archive with various files intended to be used for the tutorial (jped.tgz). The Jannovar.jar file is the 0.5 version of January 4, 2013.\r\n\r\n## Downloading the source code\r\n\r\nDevelopers can download the entire source code for the Jannovar project in the form of a maven repository from https://github.com/charite/jannovar.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nJannovar is distributed under a BSD2 license.\r\n\r\n## Publication\r\n\r\nJÃ¤ger, Marten, et al.
