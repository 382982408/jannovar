Jannovar

A Java library and executable for annotating VCF files with gene/transcript-based
annotations and adding simple pedigree/genotype filtering capabilities. This is
a maven project that integrates the test and build phases. Here are the most
important commands.



$ mvn compile
-> This compiles all the Java classes
$ mvn jar:jar
-> This builds a jar archive with all the classes but no Manifest for the
main class
$ mvn test
-> This causes all of the test classes to be executed. It also runs the
cobertura test-coverage pluiing. This causes files to be written to the
target/site/cobertura directory.
$ mvn javadoc:javadoc
-> This causes javadoc to be written to the directory
target/site/apidocs
$ mvn shaded:shaded
->This causes an executable Jar file to be created in the directory target
->One can then run Jannovar as
$ java -jar target/Jannovar.jar -H (change arguments for a particular kind of run)
