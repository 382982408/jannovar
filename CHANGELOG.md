**v0.12**

* Using `ImmutableMap` in `Translator` for small performance improvements.
* Using `StringBuilder`-based concatenation of strings for generation of HGVS
  strings etc. since this is much faster than using `String#format`.
* `GenomePosition` and `GenomeInterval` use zero-based coordinates internally
  now.
