**develop**

* Changing namespace to `de.charite.compbio.jannovar`.
* Making `VariantType#priorityLevel` a non-static member.
* Renaming `TranscriptInfo` to `TranscriptModel`.
* Moving `HG19RefDictbuilder` from tests to main.
* Using `ImmutableMap` in `Translator` for small performance improvements.
* Using `StringBuilder`-based concatenation of strings for generation of HGVS
  strings etc. since this is much faster than using `String#format`.
* `GenomePosition` and `GenomeInterval` use zero-based coordinates internally
  now.

**v0.11**
