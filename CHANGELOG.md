**develop**

* Adding `-v` and `-vv` command line options.
* Using log4j/slf4j for I/O in jannovar-core.
* Adding `PrintStream` as parameter to `JannovarOptions#print`.
* Compressing serialized file.
* Fixing problems with block substitution (delins) case (#87).
* Changing namespace to `de.charite.compbio.jannovar`.
* Making `VariantType#priorityLevel` a non-static member.
* Renaming `TranscriptInfo` to `TranscriptModel`.
* Moving `HG19RefDictbuilder` from tests to main.
* Using `ImmutableMap` in `Translator` for small performance improvements.
* Using `StringBuilder`-based concatenation of strings for generation of HGVS
  strings etc. since this is much faster than using `String#format`.
