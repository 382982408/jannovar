Jannovar

A Java library and executable for annotating VCF files with gene/transcript-based
annotations and adding simple pedigree/genotype filtering capabilities. This is
a maven project that integrates the test and build phases. Here are the most
important commands.



$ mvn compile
-> This compiles all the Java classes
$ mvn jar:jar
-> This builds a jar archive with all the classes but no Manifest for the
main class
$ mvn test
-> This causes all of the test classes to be executed. It also runs the
cobertura test-coverage pluiing. This causes files to be written to the
target/site/cobertura directory.
$ mvn javadoc:javadoc
-> This causes javadoc to be written to the directory
target/site/apidocs
$ mvn package
->This causes an executable Jar file to be created in the directory target. It makes
use of the shade:shade maven goal to package a Jar file that also includes the Apache
CLI library, i.e., it stands on its own. It does however require that all of the
test phase be performed as part of the build.
->One can then run Jannovar as
$ java -jar target/Jannovar.jar -H (change arguments for a particular kind of run)
